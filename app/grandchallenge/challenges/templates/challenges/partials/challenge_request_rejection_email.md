We are very sorry to have to inform you that we will not be able to host your challenge on our platform.
We can only support a limited number of challenges per year and hence have to be selective in reviewing proposals.
We would like to nevertheless thank you for your submission and wish you the best of luck with organizing and hosting your challenge elsewhere.
