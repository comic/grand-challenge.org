            The successful completion of the algorithm jobs listed below is a prerequisite for executing
            the evaluation method on the predictions.
            Any algorithm jobs mentioned here that have not encountered failures or been cancelled are
            presently undergoing execution within the platform.
            Your patience is appreciated during this process.
            If any of these algorithm jobs have unfortunately failed, it is typically necessary to get in
            touch with the participant to address any issues within their algorithm container.
            A job is only marked as cancelled if another job within this set has experienced a failure.
