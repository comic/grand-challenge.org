    """send_templated_mail() is a wrapper around Django's e-mail routines that allows us to easily send multipart (text/plain & text/html) e-mails using templates that are stored in the database. This lets the admin provide both a text and a HTML template for each message.

    email_template_name is the slug of the template to use for this message (see models.EmailTemplate)

    email_context is a dictionary to be used when rendering the template

    recipients can be either a string, eg 'a@b.com', or a list of strings.

    sender should contain a string, eg 'My Site <me@z.com>'. If you leave it blank, it'll use
    settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL as a fallback.

    bcc is an optional list of addresses that will receive this message as a blind carbon copy.

    fail_silently is passed to Django's mail routine. Set to 'True' to ignore any errors at send time.

    files can be a list of file paths to be attached, or it can be left blank. eg ('/tmp/file1.txt', '/tmp/image.png')
