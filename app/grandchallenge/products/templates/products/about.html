          <h2 class="h4 pt-3">Increasing transparency in AI for radiology</h2>
          <p> AI for Radiology increases transparency in the commercial artificial intelligence software available for radiology. The supply of commercial software products has rapidly increased. For the potential customers, it might not always be clear what is out there, with what regulatory clearance, and at what maturity level. Therefore, we want to increase transparency in the available AI software for radiology in Europe and aid the selection and implementation of such software.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h4">The most comprehensive overview</h2>
          <p> We provide an overview of available AI based software for clinical radiology practice. The
              focus is on the European market, therefore CE certification is a requirement for software to be on the
              main product page. Vendors are asked to provide information about their products ensuring high quality information.
              If not provided, the company and product profile will be more limited and consisting of public information
              (from e.g. websites, news articles, etc.). Currently, we are the most comprehensive overview out there.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h4">We are independent</h2>
          <p> The data aggregation and maintenance of this website is performed by the
              <a href="http://diagnijmegen.nl/" title="DIAG" target="_blank">Diagnostic Image Analysis Group</a> (DIAG)
              from the <a href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/" class="w3-hover-opacity" target="_blank">Radboud university medical center</a>
              in the Netherlands. DIAG is a research group and we have no commercial interest in this project. We do not receive any funding from the listed vendors.
