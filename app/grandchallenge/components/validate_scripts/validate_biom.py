"""
Script that validates BIOM files by passing them through a parser.
Provide the BIOM file as an argument to the script.

If the file is valid, the script will exit cleanly (0).
Raises a ValidationScriptError if the BIOM file is not valid.



The rational for having a seperate script and virtual environment is to provide
isolation of web-app and modality-specific libraries.

In the case of BIOM the clashing HDF5 libraries of the libvips library (used in panimg)
and those of h5py would lead to imports crashing when not using an virtual environment.
