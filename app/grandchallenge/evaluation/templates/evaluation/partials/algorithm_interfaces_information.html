    <p>
        Currently, you either do not have an algorithm that is compatible with this phase,
        or none of your compatible algorithms have an active algorithm image.
        Either upload a new algorithm image to one of your compatible algorithms, or create a new algorithm (see 'Manage your algorithms' button above).
        As soon as your new algorithm image is active you can return to this page to submit it to this phase.
